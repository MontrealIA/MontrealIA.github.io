At the forefront of AI, deploying superhuman agents that can learn from experience in the browser unlocks new powerful possibilities to apply AI in ways we never thought of! E.g., on a mobile device, the autonomous agent can leverage sensor data (i.e.: gyroscope or accelerometer) and take actions. True understanding comes from agents that learn by ‚Äúseeing‚Äù how they affect the world. All data stays on the client, making AI agents in the browser useful for privacy preserving applications. ‚Äú Artificial Intelligence is about recognising patterns, Artificial Life is about creating patterns. ‚Äú ‚Äî Mizuki Oka et al, #alife2018 Advanced and Impactful Open-Source TechnologiesBringing contributions by scholars recognized as the foremost authorities in their fields, Montr√©al Artificial Intelligence is ahead of trends that will profoundly influence the future of Humanity. Cutting edge open-source technologies proudly used : 1. TensorFlow.jsTraining and Deploying ML Models in the Browser TensorFlow.js uses flexible and intuitive APIs to build and train models from scratch using a low-level JavaScript linear algebra library or a high-level layers API. The TensorFlow.js model converters allows running pre-existing TensorFlow models right in the browser or under Node.js. Pre-existing ML models can be retrained using sensor data connected to the browser, or other client-side data. Three development workflows : Importing an existing, pre-trained model for inference ; Re-training an imported model quickly (transfer learning) with only a small amount of data ; and Authoring (define, train, and run) models directly in the browser. TensorFlow.js AI agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods. There‚Äôs no need to install anything. Just open a webpage, and your AI Agent is ready to run.

Reinforcement LearningGoing Beyond Input-Output Pattern Recognition ‚Äú Reinforcement learning (RL) is the subfield of machine learning concerned with decision making and motor control. It studies how an agent can learn how to achieve goals in a complex, uncertain environment. ‚Äú ‚Äî OpenAI In the past few years deep reinforcement learning started achieving state-of-the-art results. At the bleeding edge of AI, autonomous agents can learn from experience, simulate worlds and orchestrate meta-solutions. Here‚Äôs an inspiring example of a high-quality implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm : Powerful and useful application domains : Dialogue, Healthcare, Management, Robotics, Smart Grid, Supply Chains, etc. ‚Äú Self-Play is Automated Knowledge Creation. ‚Äú ‚Äî Carlos E.

TensorFlow HubReusing Machine Learning Modules TensorFlow Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph, along with its weights and assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as transfer learning. Transfer learning can: Train a model with a smaller dataset ; Improve generalization: and Speed up training. ‚Äú I think transfer learning is the key to general intelligence. And I think the key to doing transfer learning will be the acquisition of conceptual knowledge that is abstracted away from perceptual details of where you learned it from. ‚Äú ‚Äî Demis Hassabis TensorFlow Hub Introducing TensorFlow Hub by Josh Gordon Transform your Web Site with an AI AgentFully-fledged AI systems can achieve serious revenue!
