On a mobile device, the autonomous AI agent can even leverage sensor data (i.e.: gyroscope or accelerometer), perceive its environment and take actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. All data stays on the client, making AI agents in the browser useful for privacy preserving applications. We Are at the Verge of a Global Technological ShiftIn the past few years deep learning started achieving state-of-the-art results. Today‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence is powerful, useful and accessible to all. ‚Äú Artificial Intelligence is about recognising patterns, Artificial Life is about creating patterns. ‚Äú ‚Äî Mizuki Oka et al, #alife2018 Three workflows with TensorFlow.js : Existing, pre-trained model can be imported for inference ; Imported model can re-trained quickly (transfer learning) with only a small amount of data ; and Models can be directly authored (define, train, and run) in the browser. There‚Äôs no need to install any libraries or drivers. Just open a webpage, and your AI Agent is ready to run. Transform your Web Site with an AI AgentFully-fledged AI systems can achieve serious revenue! Montr√©al Artificial Intelligence helps to transform Web sites for the age of artificial intelligence by developing machine learning agents in the browser that achieves goal-oriented behavior.
