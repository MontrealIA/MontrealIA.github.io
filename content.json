From a user’s perspective, there’s no need to install any libraries or drivers : Just open a webpage, and your program is ready to run! On a mobile device, the model can take advantage of sensor data (i.e.: gyroscope or accelerometer). Finally, all data stays on the client, making TensorFlow.js useful for low-latency inference, as well as for privacy preserving applications.
